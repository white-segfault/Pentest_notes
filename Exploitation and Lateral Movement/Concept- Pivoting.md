The main idea of pivoting, lateral movement and tunnelling are defined as follows:

Pivoting:
- Using a host that is dual-homed (having more than one physical nic connected to different networks) to access resources that we otherwise would having a hard time getting. 
Lateral movement:
 -  An technique used to gain access to other hosts 
 - I would generalise it as, access to other resource of the same level, but may reveal other vulnerabilities that can only be found on that resource. 
Tunnelling:
- Obfuscation/encrypting of our traffic.
Some reflective notes:
- TCP connect scan over a range of host will be one of the last resort. 

## Skills Assessment
```
A team member started a Penetration Test against the Inlanefreight environment but was moved to another project at the last minute. Luckily for us, they left a `web shell` in place for us to get back into the network so we can pick up where they left off. We need to leverage the web shell to continue enumerating the hosts, identifying common services, and using those services/protocols to pivot into the internal networks of Inlanefreight. Our detailed objectives are `below`:
	- Start from external (`Pwnbox or your own VM`) and access the first system via the web shell left in place.
	- Use the web shell access to enumerate and pivot to an internal host.
	- Continue enumeration and pivoting until you reach the `Inlanefreight Domain Controller` and capture the associated `flag`.
	- Use any `data`, `credentials`, `scripts`, or other information within the environment to enable your pivoting attempts.
	- Grab `any/all` flags that can be found.
	
-> Illustrates how to start pivoting, you need a shell somehow in the environment. 

// Questions
Once on the webserver, enumerate the host for credentials that can be used to start a pivot or tunnel to another host in the network. In what user's directory can you find the credentials? Submit the name of the user as the answer
	-> Illustrate the importance of iterative enumeration. On an host? Enumerate for credentials/escalate for privileges first. 

Submit the credentials found in the user's home directory. (Format: user:password)
	-> Illustrate how enumerate can reap as important credentials like this. In particular, to pivot to host, we need credentials that supports it. 

Enumerate the internal network and discover another active host. Submit the IP address of that host as the answer.
	-> Again, once we have the credentials from previous effort, we need to enumerate before pivoting. 

Use the information you gathered to pivot to the discovered host. Submit the contents of C:\Flag.txt as the answer.
	-> Illustration of pivoting to a new host, which sets up further attacks. 

In previous pentests against Inlanefreight, we have seen that they have a bad habit of utilizing accounts with services in a way that exposes the users credentials and the network as a whole. What user is vulnerable?
	-> Combined with the previous question (conditions set up), we can now do password attacks (dumpping lsass, sam, tickets...) with the privileges.

For your next hop enumerate the networks and then utilize a common remote access solution to pivot. Submit the C:\Flag.txt located on the workstation.
	-> Now we pivot using this credential to another work station, this time it turned out to have access to the domain controller as well! And since our user is privielged, the domain is compromised.
