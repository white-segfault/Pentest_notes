## Host Based Enumeration

#### FTP
```
bc= Have ftp service can connect to

## Dangerous Settings

C= bc
P= Gain useful info 

## Footprinting the Service

C= bc
P= To find information about the service/host

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can grab the banner of ftp service through direct interaction
-> Illustrates how we can use the misconfiguration of ftp service to grab some useful info.
```

#### SMB
```
bc=Have an SMB service to connect to

## Dangerous Settings

C= bc
P= Gain useful info

## Footprinting the service

C= bc
P= To find information about the host/service

## Questions
-> Illustrate how we can enumerate lots of information about the host/domain, customisation and gain useful information from it. 
```

#### NFS
```
bc= Have an NFS service to connect to 

## Footprinting the Service

C= bc
P= Gain useful info

## Questions
-> Illustrate how you can obtain useful info through mounting the file system hosted by NFS.
```

#### Footprinting
```
bc= Have DNS server to interact with

## General

C= bc
p= Gain useful info (mostly identifying/increasing attack surface)

## Footprinting the service
C= bc
p= Gain useful info (mostly identifying/increasing attack surface)

## Questions
-> Illustrated the FQDN for typical ns servers,
misconfiguration causing zone transfers and internal zone transfer (in particular the any dns query about the internal cannot be queried to the DNS server),
identifying internal DNS servers (dev.inlanefreight.htb) and performing dns brute-forcing on it (when zone-transfer is unavailable).
```

#### SMTP
```
bc = Have SMTP service to interact with

## Default Configuration

C= bc, to enumerate user requires a wordlist
P= Gain useful info, enumerate users (given a wordlist)

## Footprinting the service

C=bc
P= Gain useful info about the smtp service

## Questions
-> Illustrating again how nmap enumeration may miss version info and need direct interaction to grab the banner, as well as showing how we can enumerate users using an appropriate wordlist. 
```

## IMAP / POP3
```
bc = have IMAP/POP3 service to interact with

## Footprinting the service

C= bc, have user credential (if logging in)
P= Gain useful info from the service or from the user's email(depending on level of access, i.e. whether we have credentials or not)

## Questions
-> Illustrating how nmap is not enough, access to the service is required for enumeration on IMAP/POP3. Also illustrated how debug mode, if enabled, give us extra information. 
-> Also illustrate how we can gain useful information through accessing the user's email. 
```

#### SNMP
```
bc = Have SNMP service to interact with

## Footprinting the service
Note: The service runs on udp port 161 and sometimes 162 (traps), we can do it quick nmap scan as an assurance that the service is running before we perform our footprinting.

C=bc
P=Gain useful info

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can gain useful information through the SNMP service misconfiguration.
-> Also illustrate how sometimes we have to wait a bit longer for some more useful information to be revealed (e.g. 10 minutes)
```

#### MySQL
```
bc= Have SQL service to interact with

## Footprinting the service
C=bc, credentials required if we want to log in
P=Gain useful info

## Question
-> Illustrates how we can gain useful information from the mysql database, as well as identifying its version.
```

#### MSSQL
```
bc = Have MSSQL service to interact with

## Footprinting the service
C=bc
P=Gain useful info

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can gain useful information from the mssql database, as well as its hostname. 
```

#### Oracle TNS
```
bc= Have oracle service to interact with.

## Default configuration

C=bc
P=Gain useful info

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can gain useful information (credentials) from the Oracle Database.
```

#### IPMI
```
bc= Have IPMI service to interact

C= bc
P= Gain user credentials

## Questions
-> Illustrates how to obtain user credentials through IPMI V2 flaw.
```


## Skills assessment

## Skills easy
```
- Illustrated attack chain of FTP enumeration (identified misconfiguration (FTP service containing SSH private key)).

Interesting thing is that the DNS server had misconfiguration (allows axfr zone transfer), but that doesn't lead into further foundings. 
```

Skills medium
```
- Illustrated attack chain of NFS enumeration (identified vulnerability, everyone can read the nfs share with one file containing user credential) -> SMB enumeration (identified bad practice, SMB share contains SQL admin password) -> enumerated MSSQL Database (MSSQL contains clear text credential of user). 
```

Skills Hard
```
Illustrated attack chain of
- SNMP service enumeration (identified vulnerability (weak community string vulnerable to brute force)) -> IMAP/POP3 enumeration (identified bad practices (credentials in email)) -> SQL service enumeration (identified bad practices (password reuse))
```
