## Passive Information gathering
#### WHOIS
```
bc=Have a domain name

C=bc
P= Gather useful info

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can find useful information such as IANA number and admin email contact about the target from WHOIS
```

#### DNS
```
bc= Have a domain name

C= b
P= Gather useful info

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can find useful information such as IP addresses from domain names (and vice versa), along with mail server for a domain. 
```

#### Passive Subdomain Enumeration
```
bc= Have a domain name

C= bc
P= To gather subdomain information of the domain
```

#### Passive Infrastructure Identification
```
bc = Have a domain name

Netcraft/ Wayback Machine

C= bc
P= To identify infrastruture info about the target domain.
```

## Active Information Gathering
#### Active Infrastructure Identification
```
bc= Have a domain/target to access

## Web Servers

C= bc
P= To obtain infrastructure info about the target domain.

## Questions
-> Ilustrates how insfrastructure info like webserver version, cms system and operating system can be identified.
```

#### Active Subdomain Enumeration
```
bc= Have a domain/target to access

## Zonetransfers

C= bc
P= To obtain subdomain info about the target domain

## GoBuste
C= bc, Have a pattern in file (for a more specific search)
P= To obtain subdomain info about the target domain

## Questions
-> Illustrates how subdomain info can be enumerated by DNS servers, including high target values like app, customer and dmz. 
```

#### Crawling
```
bc= Have a domain/target to access

## ZAP/FFuF/Sensitive Information Disclosure

C= bc
P= To gain useful info about the target (attack surface overview, subdomains, sensitive Information Disclosure...)
```

## Skills Assessment
```
-> Illustrated the use of both passive and active enumeration techniques on identifying infrastructure and subdomains, including critical looking ones (like data-triage-reports).
