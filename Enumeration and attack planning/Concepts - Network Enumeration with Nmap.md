// Questions
-> Illustrates how TTL can be used to determine operating system.
```

#### Host and Port Scanning
```
bc = Have Ip List/multiple IP/Single IP

C= bc 
P= Identification of protection mechanism like firewall

## Discovering Open UDP ports

-> Illustrates how nmap scan be used to discover TCP open ports and hostname of target
```

#### Saving the Results
```
bc = Have Ip List/multiple IP/Single IP

## Different Formats

C= bc
P= Organise our nmap scan result

## Style sheet

C= Have xml nmap scan result 
P= Present easy-to-read nmap scan result in HTTP 

// Questions
-> Illustrates how we can generate easy-to-read result in HTTP for nmap scan
```

#### Service Enumeration
```
bc = Have Ip List/multiple IP/Single IP

## Service Version Detection

C= bc
P= Provide service info about ports

## Banner Grabbing

C= bc
P= Provide the banner of the service

// Questions
-> Illustrates how sometimes Nmap does not capture everything for Service enumeration and sometimes we have to manually access the service with nc or/and with Tcpdump to intercept the traffic to see the banner. 
```

#### Nmap Scripting Engine
```
bc = Have Ip List/multiple IP/Single IP

## general

C= bc
P= Provide additional various info about the target/s

## Vulnerability assessment

C=bc
P= Does a vulnerability assessment on the target

// Questions
-> Illustrates how we can perform vulnerability assessment on services such a web serverm which may reveal useful information about the target.
```

#### Performance
```
bc = Have Ip List/multiple IP/Single IP

## Timeouts

C= bc
P= Tune the RTT time for packet recevied, may increase speed of scanning

## Max Retries

C= bc
P= Tune the max retries for nmap scans, may increase speed of scanning

## Rates

C= bc
P= Tune the number of packets to send per minute, may increse speed of scanning

## Timing

C= bc
P= Tune the number of packets too send per minute in a dynamic fashion, may increase speed of scanning
```

## Bypass Security Measures
#### Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion
```
bc = Have Ip List/multiple IP/Single IP, potential firewall/IPS/IDS system

## Determine Firewalls and Their rules

C= bc
P= Determine if their is a firewall and whether their rules (packet is dropped/rejected...)

## Decoys

C= bc
P= Bypass IPS/IDS system

DNS Proxying
C= bc
P= Bypass IPS/IDS system
```

## Skills Assessment
#### Skills 1
```
- Illustrates how web server (usually running on port 80) can tell you the OS system version
```

#### Skills 2
```
- Illustrates how we can still scan the target that blocks ping by using -pn and targetting DNS server through udp port 53.
```

#### Skills 3
```
- Illustates how we can bypass firewall/IDS/IPS protection through the DNS proxying technique. 
- Then, the banner of the service can be grabbed through nc
```
