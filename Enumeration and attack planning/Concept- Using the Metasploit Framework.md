## Introduction

#### Introduction to Metasploit
```
bc= nothing

C=nothing
P= Understand the architecture of metasploit for convenient future use

```

## MSF Components

#### Modules
```
bc= Have a target to access

## Searching for modules

C= When you want to use a module for some reason
P= Allows to select module later on

## Module selection

C= When you searched a module
P= Allows the use of a module later on

## Using Modules

C= When you've selected a module
P= Allow you to run the module, performing some functionality.

## Questions
-> Illustrates how metasploit moduleyou can handle payload selection, delivery and execution within just the use of a module (manually wwould take a step for each step) 
```

#### Targets
```
bc= Have a target to access

C= When we are using an exploit module and want to tune the target parameter.
P= Help us use the module correctly. 
```

Payloads
```
bc= Have a target to access

## Searching for payloads

C= When we have selected a module
P= Enable us select the appropriate payload for the module

## Selecting Payloads

C= When we have searched for payloads
P= Enable us to execute the module with appropriate payload. 

## Using Payloads

C= When we have execute the module and it ran successful (e.g. got a meterpreter session)
P= Enable us to perform post-exploitation activity with enhanced user-experience. 

## Questions
-> Illustrated how exploitation in Metasploit works:
	- Gather info from target, perform vulnerability assessement, exploit it with metasploit module and perform post-exploitation with the convenient payload. 
```

#### Encoders
```
bc= Have a payload to use

## Selecting an encoder
C= bc and there is AV/EDR present on the target system
P= Bypass AV/EDR detection

Note: Encoders are not enough at all for AV evasion these days, they are out of the scope for the modules. 
```

#### Databases

```
bc= Have a target to interact with

## Setting up a database

C= bc
P= Prepare ourselves to use the database with integration with Metasploit

## Using the database

C= bc, database set up
P= Another way of being organised with the info to be obtained in the future

## Imported Scan result

C= bc, database setup, have a nmap scan result (in xml format)
P= Another way of being organised with the info (scan result) obtained

## Using Nmap inside MSFconsole

C= bc, have database setup
P= Another way to perform enumeration with organisation (in msfconsole)

## Data backup

C= bc, have data to be backed up
P= To backup data obatined (work on it next time)

## Hosts/Services/Credentials/Loot

C= bc, have database setup
P= Access to other functionality integrated with msfconsole and the database.
```

#### Plugins
```
bc= Have a host to access

## Using Plugins

C= Have plugin want to use installed
P= Speeds up our workflow (automate repetitive task)

## Installing new Plugins

C= Have a plugin wanting to be installed
P= Prepares the plugin to be used
```

## MSF Sessions
```
bc= Have a session established with metasploit

## Using Sessions

C= bc
P= Improved experience during post-exploitation

## Jobs

C= nothing
P= provides general knowledge about job and how to free up ports in metasploit.

## Questions
-> Illustrated an attack chain of enumeration -> exploitation -> post exploitation, utilizing session, all done in metasploit.
```

#### Meterpreter
```
bc= Have a target we are accessing

## Using Meterpreter

C= bc, for using actual meterpreter requires a successful exploitation and uses meterpreter for the payload. 
P= Could be an improved experience for some for the big picture or just for the exploitation and post-exploitation section. 
```


## Additional Sections

#### Writing and importing Modules
```
bc= Have a module we are searching for or importing a module

## Searching and importing modules

C= bc
P= Allows to search or/and import a module into metasploit.
```

#### Introduction to MSFVenom
```
bc= Have a target are interacting with

## Creating Our Payloads

C= bc, know what the payload the target accepts
P= Allows us to deliver the payload and execute it later on

## Executing the Payloads

C= bc, delivered the payload and know where it is located
P= Allow us to execute the payload

## Local Exploit Suggester

C= Have a reverse shell and are in post-exploitation
P= Allow us to perform post-exploitation process. 

Note:
- Demonstrated an attack chain of using msfvenom with handler then performed post-exploitation using msfconsole.
