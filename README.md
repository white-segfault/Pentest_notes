These are my notes on Hack The Box (HTB) academy’s Penetration Tester Path. It is a prerequisite before attempting the CPTS exam: [https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist)

The notes are separated into four sections: Information Gathering, Exploitation and Lateral movement, Web Exploitation. and Privilege Escalation.

The name of the note either starts as CMD or Concepts. CMD is the commands that are used in the module, while Concept is my understanding of the principal of the technique.

In the notes starting with the name Concept, three custom notations are used for convenience, they are denoted as bc, C and P, where bc stands for basic condition, C stands for condition and P stands for potential progress. Since every attack/technique requires some sort of pre-condition for it to work with some probability of success, this way of notation helps me understand when to execute an attack, its impact, and planning or execution of an attack chain. 

A couple of more notes are yet to be polished and updated later (they have been completed already), these are File Upload attacks, Command Injections, Web Attacks (HTTP Verb tampering, IDOR, XXE Injection), Attacking Common Applications, Linux Privilege Escalation and Windows Privilege Escalation.
