## Skills Assessment

```
## Skills 1
-> Illustrated how Tomcat is a nice target that we should always look at.
-> Also illustrated the CGI vulnerability and how to handle it if we can't exploit it in the section. We just have to follow the methodology  given in other notable applications and exploit it accordingly. 

-> One suprising thing was the auto check saying not exploitable, but turned out to be exploitable! This shows the importance of understanding the exploit and not blindly trusting the tools. 

## Skills 2
-> Illustrated the importance of fuzzing for vhosts (for enumeration when vhosts are present), and illustration of chaining attacks through multiple web applications (gitlab for credential exposure followed by attack on nagios cve)

## Skills 3
-> Illustrated how we can find useful binaries through web application development sites and reversing them may yield credentials!
