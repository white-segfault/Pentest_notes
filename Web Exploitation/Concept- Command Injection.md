## Exploitation
#### Detection
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Command Injection Detection
C= bc
P= Better understanding of OS injection

## Command Injection Methods
C= bc
P= Understand the various injection methods
```

#### Injecting Commands
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Injecting Our Command
C= bc
P= To test our injection commands.

## Bypassing Front-End Validation
C= bc, uses an front-end validation
P= To bypass front-end validation

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can identify front-end validation through front-end source code analysis. 
```

#### Other Injection Operators
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## AND Operator / ## OR Operator
C= bc
P= Extra operator for command injection

## Questions
	-> Illustrate how we can perform various command injections and how | only shows output of injected operations.
```

## Filter Evasion
#### Identifying Filters
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Filter/WAF Detection
C= bc
P= Detect whether a filter or WAF is blocking our request,

## Blacklisted characters
C= bc
P= Have a better understanding of the filters

## Identifying Blacklisted character
C= bc, have a blacklist filter
P= To identify which character is not blocked by the filter

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can identify blacklisted and non-blacklisted character. 
```

#### Bypassing Space FIlters
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Bypass Blacklisted Operators
C= bc
P= Bypass blacklisted Operators

## Bypass Blacklisted Spaces
C= bc, space is blacklisted
P= Bypass space filter

## Questions
-> Illustrated how we can bypass various space filters using other equivalent operators.
```

#### Bypassing Other Blacklisted Characters
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Linux
C= bc, have blacklisted characters like space, ; and target is Linux machine
P= To bypass blacklisted characters

## Windows
C= bc, have blacklisted characters like space, ; and target is windows machine
P= To bypass blacklisted characters


## Character Shifting
C= bc, have any blacklisted characters and target is Linux
P= To bypass blacklisted characters in a more general sense


## Work flow:
C= bc
P= An organised workflow/methdology for testing command injection


## Questions
-> Illustrate how we injection character can't replace the functionality of injection characters like new line characters(? not fully sure but this is seeming like the case), instead they become part of the proper command.

-> Also illustrates how we execute commands through replacing characters that are blacklisted
```


#### Bypassing Blacklisted Commands
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Commands Blacklist
C= bc
P= Better understanding of command blacklist

## Linux & Windows
C= bc, command blacklist is applied
P= Bypass commands blacklist in Linux and Windows

## Linux Only
C= bc, command blacklist is applied, against a Linux target
P= Additional ways to bypass blaclist commands in Linuxx

## Windows Only
C= bc, command blacklist is applied, against a Windows target
P= Additional ways to bypass blaclist commands in Windows

## Exericses 
-> Illustrates how you can combine blacklist characters, commands and client side filters all together in action. 
```

#### Advanced Command Obfuscation
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Case Manipulatiion
C= bc, there is command blacklisting
P= Bypass the command blacklisting.

## Reversed Commands
C= bc, there is command blacklisting or some important characters being url decoding being done (causes our commands to get messed up)
P= Bypass the command blacklisting.

## Encoced commands
C= bc, there is command blacklisting
P= Bypass one or more command blacklisting or chracter blacklisting.

## Exercises:
	-> Illustrate how if we have a series of command we want to execute with many blacklisted commands, characters, encoded commands may be a good way to bypass it. 
```

#### Evasion Tools
```
bc= Underlying operations/functionality likely uses an OS command

## Linux (Bashfuscator) / ## Windows (DOSfuscation)
C= bc, application has advanced filters(?)
P= An brief exposure of evasion tools and advanced exposure, probably outside the scope of exam

## Questions
-> Illustrated how we can use tools for advanced obfuscation.
```

## Command Injection Prevention
```
bc= Provide remediation to clients

## System Commands / ## Input Validation / 
## Input Sanitization / ## Server Configuration
C= bc
P= To prevent command injection vulnerability through various methods mentioned.
```
## Questions
```
-> Illustrate how we need to think about the underlying commands before attacking, as it makes the exploitation process easier.
