## Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
#### Intro to IDOR
```
bc= Have a website to target

## What makes an IDOR Vulnerability
C= bc
P= Better understanding of IDOR vulnerability, caused by lack of access control.

## Impact of IDOR vulnerabilities
C= bc
P= Better understanding of IDOR vulnerabilites and their types, namely information exposure and insecure function calls.
```

#### Identifying IDORs
```
bc= Have a website to target

## URL Parameters / AJAX Calls / ## Compare User Roles

```

#### Mass IDOR Enumeration
```
bc= Have a website to target with some parameter and reference value in POST or GET

## Insecure parameters
C= bc
P= Identify whether the parameter is secure or not.

## Mass Enumeration
C= bc, identified insecure parameters
P= Enumerated various objects (including files) with IDOR vulnerabilities (file disclosure in this section)

## Questions
-> Illustrate how IDOR can happen in POST parameter as well, not just in get.  
```

#### Bypassing Encoded References
```
bc= Have a website to target

## Encoded reference
C= bc
P= Identify whether there is an encoded reference

## Function Disclosure
C= bc, have an encoded reference
P= Turn encoded reference (appearing secure object reference) into IDOR

## Mass Enumeration
C= bc, have an IDOR
P= Exploit IDOR vulnerability and gain information disclosure.

## Questions
-> Illustrate how we can bypass encoded references on get requests, while the section focuses on post requests.
```

#### IDOR in Insecure APIs
```
bc = Have a website to target

## Identifying Insecure APIs
C= bc
P= Identify whether there is an insecure API

## Exploiting Insecure APIs
C= bc, web is running an insecure API
P= Attempt to exploit insecure API, furthering our access

## Exercise
-> Combined with the examples in the section, illustrates how we generally do not have enough information when we identify an insecure APIs -> some form of information gathering has to be done first and here we are performing them through source code analysis.
```

#### Chaining IDOR Vulnerabilities 
```
bc= Have a website to target

## Information Disclosure
C= bc
P= Identify whether there is IDOR information disclosure

## Modifying Other User's Details
C= bc, identified IDOR information disclosure
P= Identify or verify that there is an IDOR insecure API's

## Chaining Two IDOR vulnerabilities
C= bc, identified both IDOR information disclosure and insecure API's
P= To exploit IDOR vulnerability using info obtained from IDOR information disclosuure, furthering our access.


## Questions
	-> Illustrates how if we can identify and chain IDOR information disclosure vulnerability with IDOR insecure API's to achieve an attack. 
```

#### IDOR Prevention
```
bc= Providing remediation advice to clients

## Object-Level Access Control / ## Object Referencing
C= bc
P= To prevent IDOR vulnerability.
```

## XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
#### Intro to XXE
```
bc= nothing

## XML / ## XML DTD / ## XML Entities
C= bc
P= Gain a better understanding of XML, its structure and its purpose
```

#### Local File Disclosure
```
bc= Have a website to target and uses xml in communication

## Identifying 
C= bc
P= Identifying whether the website is vulnerable to an XXE 

## Reading Sensitive Files
C= bc, website is vulnerable to XXE
P= Read sensitive files like /etc/passwd, may reveal futher vulnerability

## Reading Source code
C= bc, website is vulnerable to XXE
P= Read ssource code like index.php, may reveal futher vulnerability


## Remote Code Execution with XXE
C= bc, website is vulnerable to XXE, expect wrapper enabled in PHP
P= RCE

## Other XXE attacks
C= bc, website is vulnerable to XXE
P= DoS attack

## Questions
	-> Illustrates how we can read source file like connection.php to reveal futher vulnerability (here it is exposed credential) of the website.
```

#### Advanced File Disclosure
```
bc= Have a web application to target, vulnerable to XXE

## Advanced Exfiltration with CDATA
C= bc
P= Read content of file of any file type.

## Error based XXE
C= Have a web application to target, no response returned for xml inputs
P= Identify whether the target is vulnerable to an error based xxe and exploit it accordingly to read file

## Questions
	-> Illustrates how we can read content of file (e.g. source code) using both methods mentioned.
```

#### Blind Data Exfiltration
```
bc= Have a website to target, xml inputs gives no response (even error based xxe failed)

## Out-of-band Data Exfilitration
C= bc
P= Exfiltrate data from file for a blind situation. 

## Automated OOB Exfilitration
C= bc, confirmed to have oob exfiltration vulnerability
P= To speed up the process of oob data exfiltration

## Questions
	-> Illustrate how we can perform oob exfiltration using both manual and automated methods (ideally manual to identify and automated for like reading multi files or verfying).
```

#### XXE Prevention
```
bc= Providing remediation advice to clients

## Avoiding Outdated Components / ## Using Safe XML Configurations
C= bc
P= To prevent XXE injection attacks.
```

## Skills assessment
```
## Scenario
-> Potentially illustrated the pre-conditions for these web attacks (some level of access) and the general defintion of the word "filter" is illustrated for http verb tampering. Here it meant filter for access control! It could be something for another web application so having a good general definition would be key here.

-> Also showed how IDOR information disclosure may reveal more than one type of information disclosure (here we have uid and token, which are both important for changing password) that are all required to exploit IDOR in insecure api's.

-> Also showed the limitation for the advanced file exfilitration method - it could potentially not work, caused by people disbaling external entity (which is something likely), so we have to resort to native functions (though it takes more work) for xxe injection. 
```
