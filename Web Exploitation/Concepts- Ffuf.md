## Basic Fuzzing
#### Directory Fuzzing
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist

## Directory Fuzzing
C= bc
P= Gain a better understanding of Ffuf and fuzz for directory of the website (setting up for page fuzzing)

## Questions
-> Illustration of directory fuzzing
```

#### Page Fuzzing
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist

## Extension Fuzzing
C=bc
P= Gain a better understanding of Ffuf and fuzz for page of the website (setting up for page fuzzing)

## Page fuzzing
C=bc, have a directory and known what extension the page uses.
P= Gain a better understanding of Ffuf and fuzz for pages of the website.

## Questions
-> Illustration of extension fuzzing followed by page fuzzing
```

#### Recursive Fuzzing
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist

## Recursive Flags
C= bc
P= Gain a better understanding of Ffuf and recursively fuzzes for pages of the website

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can recursively fuzz pages with websites
```

## Domain Fuzzing
#### DNS Records
```
bc= Have a website to target,
## Sub-domain
C= bc, have website IP and domain name
P= To be able to access the website using its domain name
```

#### Sub-domain Fuzzing
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist


C= bc, also website can be accessed through public dns
P= Obtain public domain of the website.

// Questions:
-> Illustrates how we cn find public subdomain of the website using sub-domain fuzzing.
```

#### Vhost Fuzzing
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist

## Vhost Fuzzing
C= bc, host has both IP address and domain name
P= Example illustration of vhost fuzzing, also sets up for Filtering results vhost fuzzing (look for default response size)
```

#### Filtering Results
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist

## Filerting
C= bc, accomplished vhost Fuzzing
P= To obtain vhosts for the target (vhost fuzzing technique in informaton-gathering web-edition)
```

#### Parameter Fuzzing - GET
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist

## Get Request Fuzzing
C= bc
P= To identifity get parameters accepted by the page (sets up for various web attacks, including value fuzzing, SQL injection)
```

#### Parameter Fuzzing - POST
```
bc= Have a website to target, appropriate wordlist

C= bc
P= To identify get parameters accepted by the page (sets up for various web attacks, including value fuzzing, SQL injection)
```

#### Value Fuzzing
```
bc= Have a parameter whose value can be fuzzed

C= bc, appropriate wordlist
P= To identify values for fuzzable parameters, which could expose unintended information or gain further access.
```

## Skills assessment
```
-> Illustrated how various fuzzing techniques can be useful in revealing additional info about the web.  
-> But using it to attack a website, reveals to be a bit hard, more of a preparation for other techniques.
