## Getting Started
#### SQLMap Overview
```
bc= nothing

## Supported SQL Injection Types
C= bc
P= Better understanding of SQLMap

## Question 
- Illustrates how Union query-based SQL injection is the fastest. 
```

#### Getting Started with SQLMap
```shell-session
bc= have a web page and parameter to target

## Help menu
C= bc
P= To gain better understanding of SQLMap

## Basic Scenario
C= bc
P= An example show casing SQLMap to better understand it. 
```

#### SQLMap Output Description
```
bc= Ran a sqlmap command

## Log Message Description
C= bc
P= Helps comprehend the output and Sqlmap and better understanding its usage. 
```

## Building Attacks
#### Running SQLMap on HTTP Request
```
bc= Have a parameter (e.g. various http requess parameter) to be tested for sql injection.
- Also did some brief testing on sqli injection (different payloads injected) and work flow injection on suspicious character. 

## Curl Commands
C= bc
P= One way of running sql map command for short/non-complicated requests

## Full HTTP Requests
C= bc
P= One way of running sql map command for longer/complicated requests

## Custom SQLMap Requests
C= bc, have a custom parameter to test (e.g. cookie values)
P= To run sql map command for custom parameters

## Custom HTTP Requests
C= bc, have a custom HTTP request which contains testing parameter (e.g. json data format)
P= To run sql map command for custom HTTP Requests

## Questions
-> Illustrated the various techniques for Sqlmap utilised in this section, including curl commands, custom SQLMap Requests and Custom HTTP Requests.
```

#### Handling SQLMap Errors
```
bc= Running sqlmap on a parameter

## Display Errors
C= bc
P= To displaying error from the database and helps debugging

## Store the traffic
C= bc
P= Store traffics for further analysis and helps debugging.

## Verbose Output
C= bc
P= To see more information from the output and helps debugging

## Using Proxy
C= bc
P= To redirect traffic through a proxy, which may furhter analysis
```

Attack Tuning
```
bc= Have a parameter to inject on a website, have possibly queries reversed and can think of how to inject the query

## Prefix/Suffix
C= bc
P= To set up for a successful SQL map/injection attack.
Note:
-> Also illustate why we might have the payload ')), due to the specfic query LIKE (())

## Level/Risk
C= bc
P= To set up for a successful SQL map/injection attack.

## Advanced Tuning
C= bc
P= To set up for a successful SQL map/injection attack.

## Exercises
-> Illustrate the importance of doing sqli discovery before attempting the attack on standard parameter. (e.g. Post and Get Parameter).
	-> This makes SQLMap not a "blackbox" anymore and allows the tunning of attack. 
-> Also raised awareness on how non-standard characters like backticks ` may be used around column/table identifiers and need to custom prefix/boundaries for it. 

	-> The exercises illustrated SQLi discovery and attack on risk, boundaries and SQL union column tuning.
		-> In particular, high risk may cause loss of data but is sometime needed (e.g. or injection on login page)
	-> Also need to be aware of --batch option, it automates for you but sometimes we don't want it, always best to tune it manually (in particular when we don't need to go beyond level1 for risk.)
	-> Json is still only left out, as unsure.

## Database Enumeration
#### Database Enumeration
```
bc= functionality vulnerable to SQL injection

## SQLMap Data Exfilitration
C= nothing
P= To gain a better understanding of SQL usage

## Basic DB Data Enumeration
C= bc
P= To enumerate info about database, sets up for Table enumeration

## Table Enumeration
C= bc, Basic DB Data enumeration completed
P= To enumerate info about table of database, sets up for Table/row or Conditional enumeration

## Table/Row Enumeration
C= bc, Table Enumeration completed
P= To enumerate info about row of a table, reduces number of columsn queried from Table Enumeration. 

## Conditional Enumeration
C= bc, Table Enumeration completed
P= To enumerate info about a specific row of a table based on some condition.

## Full DB Enumeration
C- bc, Basic DB Data enumeration completed
P= Convenient way to dump all the info from a specific database. 

## Questions
-> Illustrate how we can enumerate all the info from the database in a systematic way using SQLMap.
```

#### Advanced Database Enumeration
```
bc= functionality vulnerable to SQL injection

## DB Schema Enumeration
C= bc
P= To get the full schema information (metadata of table from each database) from the database, generally we don't do it but good illustration of functionality of SQLMap

## Searching for Data
C= bc
P= To search for a specific table that we might be interesting in. Sets up for Password Enumeration and Cracking.

## Password Enumeration and Cracking
C= bc, know what table you want to enumerate and the table has passwords
P= To enumerate the table and crack passwords, furthering our access

## DB Users Password Enumeration and Cracking
C= bc
P= To obtain password/credentials for database-specific credentials (e.g. connection credentials)

## Questions
-> Illustrate how we can search for table given a specific column we are interested in, as well as illustrating how we can crack passwords of a table and combining that with techniques taught in Database enumeration to reduce the size of queries to be more specific. 
```


## Advanced SQLMap Usage
#### Bypassing Web Application Protections
```
bc= Performing SQLMap on a possibily vulnerable parameter and performed manual SQLi discovery on parameters we can (e.g. post/get and http parameters we can modify on burpsuite or input through the website).

## Anti-CSRF Token Bypasses
C= bc, have Anti-CSRF token like parameter
P= To allow SQLMap to run successfully.

## Unique Value Bypass
C= bc, have parameters that require unique values
P= To allow SQLMap to run successfully.

## Calculated Parameter Bypass
C= bc, have parameters that require to be calculated based on some function of some other parameter
P= To allow SQLMap to run successfully.

## IP Address Concealing
C= bc, when IP addresses is blacklisted from the website
P= To allow SQLMap to run successfully.

## WAF Bypasses
C= bc, to ignore WAF checks
P= To generate less noise and more importantly let SQLMap run faster. 

## User-agent Blacklisting Bypass
C= bc, user-agent (e.g. using default SQLMap) getting blacklisted by website
P= To allow SQLMap to run successfully.

## Tamper Scripts
C= bc, some input (e.g. '>' and '<') are being blacklisted by the website
P= To allow SQLMap to run successfully.

## Miscellaneous Bypasses
C= bc, good to know bypasses to try when out of ideas and know that parameter is likely vulnerable to SQLMap
P= To allow SQLMap to run successfully.

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can bypass Anti-csrf, unique values, IP Address Concealing, WAF Bypasses, user-agent Blacklisting and Tamper Scrpts for SQLMap.
```

#### OS Exploitation
```
bc= Functinality vulnerable to sql injection, have appropriate privileges for read (LOAD_DATA and INSERT) and write (--secure-file-priv and File privilege enabled)

## Reading Local Files
c= bc
P= To read local files, furthering our access

## OS Command Execution
c= bc, know what language the webserver runs/accepts
P= To run commands on the system, furthering our access

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can read from files and run OS commands using SQLMap if the target is vulnerable and we have the right privileges.
