## XSS Basics
#### Stored XSS
```
bc= Identified an input field that gets processed at the backend

## XSS Testing Payloads
C= bc
P= To understand the basics of XSS and could be used as an test on XSS discovery

## Questions
-> Illustrate how we can obtain information such as cookie
```

#### Reflected XSS
```
bc= Identified an input field that gets processed at the backend

C= bc
P= To understand the basics of XSS and could be used as an test on XSS discovery

## Questions
- Input: <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

#### DOM XSS
```
bc= Identified an input field that gets processed at the front-end/browser

## Source & Sink
C= bc
P= Helps you identify the source and sink of the browser, sets up for DOM attack

## DOM Attacks
C= bc, identified the source and sink and sink seems vulnerable.
P= Perform an DOM XSS attack

## Questions:
-> Illustrates how we cn deliver payload for DOM XSS attack.
```

#### XSS Discovery
```
bc= Identified an input field that gets processed at the front-end/browser

## Automated Discovery / ## Manual Discovery
C= bc
P= To Discover xss vulnerability

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can find vulnerbailities through automated tools like xsstrike and for discovering its type, we can refer to whether it's persistent and uses http request or not. 
```

## XSS  Attacks
#### Defacing
```
bc= Have functionality vulnerable to xss

## Defacing elements
C= bc
P= To help undderstand the elements relevant to defacingi

## Changing Background / ## Changing Page Title / ## Changing Page Text
C= bc
P= To change the corresponding parts (background, title, page text), which constitue a major part of the website
```

#### Phishing

```
bc= Identified an input field that gets processed at front/back end

## XSS Discovery
C= bc
P= To discover XSS vulnerability, sets up for future attacks on phishing


## Login Form Injection
C= bc, has XSS vulnerability
P= To construct the main component for the phishing page, main part of construcitng the XSS payload 

## Cleaning up
C= bc, Finished Login Form Injection
P= To finish up the payload construction, making it look legit and ready for deliver.

## Credential Stealing
C= bc, Finished Cleaning up constructing the payload
P= To steal credentials from the admin, furthering our access

## Questions
-> Illustrates how the above all work together (XSS Discovery -> Login Form Injejction -> Cleaning up -> Credential Stealing) alongside with a technique for XSS Discovery:
	Deliver XSS payload then tune it accordingly.

```

#### Session hijacking
```
bc= Have a website with functionality that processes user input and some user will click on some link.

## Blind XSS Detection
C= bc
P= To gain an understanding of Blind XSS and possible detections on it.

## Loading a Remote Script
C= bc
P= To perform Blind XSS detection and sets up for session Hijacking

## Session Hijacking
C= bc, blind XSS detection identified.
P= To perform session Hijacking.

Note:
- blind xss has higher success rate with DOM XSS type vulnerability.
- If we can identify that a field is validated or sanitized (e.g. through a combinaton of bypassing front end and testing on the back end, then we don't have to test for such fields. E.g. is email column and password in this exercise)

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can detect and identify blind xss vulnerability and exploit it to get the cookie and use to to bypass authentication.
```

## Skills assessment
```
-> Illustrates the full condition for XSS related attacks:
	- User clicking on the link (phishing) or session hijacking attacks (blind XSS injection)
	- Blind XSS can be strong because as long as the user (e.g. admin) browse to the vulnerable website (not need to click links), the cookie will be stolen.

-> Also the realism for xss attack, i.e. where it often happen are places where there are lack of filtering (e.g. comments section), you don't it happening often for emails or password related section. 

-> Also gives a bit hint:
	When stuck about an attack, we can always refer back to the modules and see when they're likely to occur. 
	The modules do a great job of illustrating the developer's mindset with regards to the vulnerability and where there might be vulnerabilties.
