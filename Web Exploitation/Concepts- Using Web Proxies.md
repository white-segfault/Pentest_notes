Reflection
```
- Most relevant section will probably be the web crawling (zap spider and zap ajax spider), as part of the web enumeration stage (supplementing material from information gathering- web edition).
	- Can also supplement with FFuF as well. 

- Active scans are also nice for some automated checks that can run on the background. 
```


## Skills assessment
```
-> Illustrates how web proxies can help in various ways, including:
	- Automatially changing HTTP responses, which can be useful such as enabling a feature we want to test (e.g.  buttons here)

	- Illustrates how we can use Burp to encode and decode various things (e.g. cookie)

	- Illustrates how we can also fuzz for cookies (or other important things) through combining info we gained from the decoder.

	- Illustrates how web proxies can even be middle man even for metapsloit modules (as long as you interact with the web, it can act as an middle man for attack or defensive purposes)

-> Take 

also an additional:
- How to do dns brute forcing by first quering/finding the name server in a systematic way.
Do the same thing for dig?
