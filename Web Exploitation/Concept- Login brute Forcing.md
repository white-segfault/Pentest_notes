## Basic HTTP Auth Brute Forcing
#### Default Passwords
```
bc= Have a website to target

## Default Passwords
c= bc, website uses http-basic authentication, have appropriate combined credentials wordlist
P= Gain authorisation for the webpage (further access). 

## Questions
-> Illustrates how to perform default password attacks on basic http authentication
```

#### Username Brute Force
```
bc= Have a website to target, a web form using http basic authentication

## Wordlists
C= bc
P= Preparing for a username/password or username brute force attack


## Username/Password Attack
C= bc, have appropriate word lists (username/list and password/list)
P= To gain credentials/authorisation and further our access

## Username Brute Force
C= bc, have a candidate password and password/list and username list,
P= To gain credentials/authorisation and further our access

## Questions
-> Illustrates how to perform username brute force on basic http authentication and gain authorisation/credentials
```

#### Hydra Modules
```
bc= Have a website to target, website with form login(get/post)

## Brute Forcing Forms
C= bc
P= To set up for Login Form attack

## Fail/Success String
c= bc
P= To set up for Login Form attack
```

#### Determine Login Parameters
```
bc= Have a website to target, website with form login(get/post)

## Using Browser
C= bc
P= A way to set up for Login Form attack

## Using Burp Suite
C= bc
P= A way to set up for Login Form attack
```

#### Login Form Attacks
```
bc= Have a website to target, website with form login(get/post)

## Default Credentials
C= bc
P= Gain authorisation and further our access

## Password Wordlist
C= bc
P= Gain authorisation and further our access

## Questions
-> Illustrated the gaining of authorisation through Login Form attack
```

## Service Authentication Attacks
#### Personalized Wordlists
```
bc= Have some user information, end goal of brute force of some service

## CUPP
C= bc
B= To set up an appropriate customized password list (setting up for service authentication brute forcing)

## Password Policy
C= bc, have password policy of the service and appropriate customized password list
B= To fine tune our customized password list


## Mangling
C= bc, have password policy of the service and appropriate customized password list
B= To fine tune our customized password list

## Custom Username Wordlist
C= bc, have username info (usually first and last name)
B= To set up an appropriate username list (setting up for service authentication brute forcing)
```

#### Service Authentication Brute Forcing
```
bc= Have a service to brute force, have appropriate username and password list, requires hydra on the local machine (if not it is not a problem, we can pivot).

## SSH Attack
C= bc
P= Obtain credentials and further access

## FTP Brute Forcing
C= bc, different user to brute force
P= Obtain credentials and further access


## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can obtain credentials for user and further access through Service Authentication Brute Forcing (when appropriate conditions are met).
```

## Skills assessment
#### Skills Assessment- Website
```
-> Other than illustrating brute force attack chain, it also hinted us the preconditions of the attack, that is, maybe some website running on a single TCP port (?).
-> Illustrates that username reuse is also an important attack to test:
Attack on default crdentials, attack on `admin`, `administrator`, `wpadmin`, `root`, `adm`, attack on reused username for webform brute forcing. 
```

#### Skills Assessment- Website
```
-> Illustrated service authentication brute force attacks uaing crafted wordlist. 
```


Note:
- There could be additional conditions required for the attack missed, but these serve as a god guide line. Adapt to the environment and always think critically about whether the condition for attack is met or not.
