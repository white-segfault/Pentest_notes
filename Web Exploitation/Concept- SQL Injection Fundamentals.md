```

## SQL Injections
#### Intro to SQL Injections
```
bc= have a website with login/search functionality/likely interact with database functionality

## Use of SQL in Web Applications / ## SQL Injection / ## Syntax Errors
C= bc
P= Gain a better understanding of SQL injections
```

#### Subverting Query Logic
```
bc= have a website with login page

## Authentication Bypass
C= bc
P= Preparing for SQLi Discovery

## SQLi Discovery
C= bc
P= To discover possible injection (first basic check)

## OR Injection
C= bc
P= To discover possible injection (a more thorough check with payloads of all things) and possibly bypass it at the same time. 

## Auth Bypass with OR operator
C= bc, discovered possible injection
P= To bypass authentications

## Questions
-> Illustrate how to perform SQL injection by constructing appropriate query. 

## Extra notes
-> A good idea would be to create this as a wordlist and inject them using a script/intruder (rather than inputting them one at a time.).
- This is named username_payload under sql_injection
```

#### Using Comments
```
bc= Have a web form to target

## Comments
C= bc
P= Illustrating the power of comments in SQL

## Auth Bypass with comments
C= bc
P= Bypass authentication through SQL injection with comment

## Another example
C= bc
P= Another example of bypass authentication through SQL injection with comment

## Questions
-> Illustrate how we can manually tune up our sql query using comments sql injection. 
```

#### Union Clause
```
bc= Access to database

## Union / ## Even Columns / ## Un-even Columns
C= bc
P= Illustrate the concept and syntax of union in SQL.


## Questions
-> Illustrate how we can perform union query on uneven columns or even columns. 
```

#### Union Injection
```
bc= Access to something that can query from the database (e.g. a search page that seems to be querying the database)

## Injection detection
C= bc
P= Identify SQL injection vulnerability, sets up for future related attacks.

## Detect number of columns
C= Functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection
P= Identify the number of columns the table has, sets up for future related attacks. 

## Questionos
-> Illustrate how we can identify vulnerability of SQL injection of functionality and number of columns of the table has.
```

## Exploitation
#### Database Enumeration
```
bc= Have access to functionality vulnerable to SQL injection and functionality type is search-related

## MySQL Fingerprinting
C= bc
P= To identify type of SQL database being used

## INFORMATION_SCHEMA Database
C= bc, database fingerprinting has be done
P= To give an overview of the functionality of INFORMATION_SCHEMA database (giving meta-data of datbases)

## SCHEMATA
C= bc, database fingerprinting has be done
P= To identify the databse name existing in the SQL server, sets up for future related exploitation.

## Tables
C= bc, database name identification has to be done.
P= To identify the table existing on the queried database, sets up for future related exploitation

## COLUMNS
C= bc, table identification has to be done.
P= To identify the columns existing on the queried table, sets up for future related exploitation

## Data
C= bc, Column identification has to be done
P= Extracting info from the SQL database, furthering our access

## Exercises
-> Illustrates the whole processes all at once on a different database. 
```

#### Reading Files
```
bc= Completed Database Enumeration

## Privileges
C= bc
P= Identify the privileges we have, sets up for future related exploitation (e.g. LOAD_File)

## LOAD_FILE
C= bc, have appropriate privilege (FILE variable) for loading file
P= Load files to further our access

## Another Example
C= bc, have appropriate privilege (FILE variable) for loading file
P=  Load files to (e.g. reading source file of websites) further our access (example of misconfiguration is shown here which sets up for futher examination on source code)

## Questions:
-> Builds upon the notes in the section, illustrates how we can identify more vulnerabilties/misconfiguration from being able to LOAD_FILE. 
```

#### Writing Files
```
bc= Have FILE privilege enabled

## Write File Privileges
C= bc
P= To discover if we have secure_file_priv enabled and capable of writing files.

## SELECT INTO OUTFILE
C= bc, have secure_file_priv enabled
P= Illustrating how to write to files in SQL, preparing for writing web-shell/writing through SQL injection

## Writing Files through SQL Injection
C= bc, have secure_file_priv enabled
P= Illustrating how to write to througb SQL injection, preparing for writing web-shell to the web.

## Writing a Web Shell
C= bc, have secure_file_priv enabled
P= Writes webshell to the webserver, enabling RCE. 

## Questions
-> Illustrates how we can write webshell when we have the appropriate privilege and obtain RCE on the target. 
```

## Skills assessment
```
-> Illustrated how to bypass authentication, we need to be more comprehensive (using payload list with intruder is a valid and quite comprehnsive approach).
	-> We can always change username up when we also need to. 

-> The remaining thing is pretty standard, just that there are alot of rabbit holes. Quickly test them out if they are included in the course and see where they bring you, if they go out of scope then ignore it. 
	-> Going into rabbit holes are sometimes essential for comprehensive testing, but it is also equally important to jump out of it. 
```
